## Introduction
ZcanMan is a tool that helps you understand your network better. It combines the best features of well-known tools like Nmap and Scapy into one interface. With ZcanMan, you can perform various scans to identify active devices, open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities in your network. Whether you are a network administrator, a security enthusiast, or someone just starting in cybersecurity, ZcanMan is designed to be accessible and powerful.

## Features
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily integrate new features and customize the tool as needed.
- **Comprehensive Scanning**: Perform ICMP, TCP, UDP, and ARP scans.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Use SYN and ACK scans to bypass firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

## Installation
To get started with ZcanMan, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zcanman.git
    cd zcanman

    python zcanman.py
    ```

## Usage
ZcanMan is designed to be user-friendly. After running the script, you will be presented with a menu of options. Simply select the desired scan type and follow the prompts.

### Example
To perform a full port scan:
1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python zcanman.py
    ```
2. Select the "Full Port Scan" option from the menu.
3. Enter the IP address or range to scan.

## Functions
ZcanMan offers a variety of scanning and reconnaissance functions:

- **Basic NO PING Scan**: Identify active devices on the network without sending ICMP requests.
- **Specific Port Scan**: Scan specific ports on a target device to check their status.
- **Full Port Scan**: Scan all 65535 ports on a target device.
- **Service Detection**: Identify running services and their versions.
- **ARP Ping**: Identify devices on a local network segment and retrieve their MAC addresses.
- **TCP Ping**: Check if a port is open on the target IP address by sending TCP SYN packets.
- **UDP Ping**: Check if a port is open on the target IP address by sending UDP packets.
- **ICMP Ping**: Check if the target IP address is up and responding.
- **SYN Scan**: Detect open ports by sending TCP SYN packets.
- **ACK Scan**: Determine if ports are filtered by a firewall by sending TCP ACK packets.
- **Banner Grabbing**: Retrieve and display the service banner on a specified port.
- **HTTP Header Evaluation**: Display the response headers from an HTTP request.
- **OS Detection**: Determine the operating system running on a target device.
